First, we're going to create four arrays of pets. Define 4 const called: append, prepend, removeLast and removeFirst, and set all to an initial value of ["Milo", "Otis", "Garfield"]. These are the arrays that we'll work with for each exercise.
Append the pet "Odie" to the end of append.
Prepend the pet "Odie" to the beginning of prepend.
Remove the last pet from removeLast.
Remove the first pet from removeFirst.

const arr = ["Milo", "Otis", "Garfield"];
const append = arr;
const prepend = arr;
const removeLast = arr;
const removeFirst = arr;
